# Hello UI

## TODO

- split up dependencies/devDependencies so that a production build can be run off of a production install.
- add enzyme/jest unit tests
- add eslint (opinionated rules)
- add component generator script(s)
- add pages for each aspect of the project (tests, build, etc)

## Notes

- whole thing should be quite opinionated. There is a high probability that our opinions are wrong (or will be wrong in the future). this is ok. adapt the project for change.
